  <!-- EN: Escaping from this planet - it would be freedom at last, and maybe a return home.\n\nBut also incredibly dangerous.\n\nA new Ship category is available in the Architect menu from which you may build ship parts once the appropriate technology is researched. Ships require several different parts in order to launch, including a ship reactor.\n\nShip reactors take 15 days to charge up and many desperate souls want off this planet. Once you begin that process, the ship reactor will emit an energy signature detectable from thousands of kilometers away. Raiders will flock to attack you in waves, with an intensity you've never seen. Mechanoids are also known to be attracted to such energy signatures.\n\nIt won't start until you activate your ship's reactor, but when it does, it'll be ferocious. You'll need to stockpile resources, weapons, and defenses for the onslaught if you hope to escape alive. -->
