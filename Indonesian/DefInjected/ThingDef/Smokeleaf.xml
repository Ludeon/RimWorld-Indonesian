  <SmokeleafJoint.description>Smokeleaf leaves prepared in small rolls for smoking. The drug improves mood, but also increases appetite, reduces focus and slows movement. Smokeleaf use can produce a dependency.\n\nJoints can be produced at a crafting spot without equipment, and are a fixture in many traditional low-industriousness cultures.</SmokeleafJoint.description>
