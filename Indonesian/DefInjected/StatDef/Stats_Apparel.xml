  <ArmorRating_Sharp.description>The chance to affect sharp damage like bullets, knife stabs, explosions, and animal bites.\n\nUpon taking damage, first this armor rating is reduced by the attack's armor penetration value. The remaining armor rating is then compared against a random number from 0 to 100.\n\n    -If the random number is under half the armor rating, the damage deflects harmlessly.\n    -If the random number is over half the armor rating, but not higher than the armor rating, the damage is mitigated. This means it is converted into blunt damage and reduced by half.\n    -If the random number is greater than the armor rating, the armor has no effect.\n\nFor example, at 90% armor rating against an attack with 10% armor penetration, there is a 40% chance of deflecting the attack harmlessly, and a 40% chance of mitigating the damage.\n\nIn the case of apparel armor, each layer of apparel applies its armor to the attack separately, from the outside in.</ArmorRating_Sharp.description>

  <ArmorRating_Heat.description>The chance to affect temperature-related damage like burns.\n\nUpon taking damage, first this armor rating is reduced by the attack's armor penetration value.
