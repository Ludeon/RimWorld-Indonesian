  <Cassandra.label>Cassandra Classic</Cassandra.label>
  <Cassandra.description>Cassandra creates story events on a classic increasing curve of challenge and tension. She'll push you with dangerous events, then give breathing room, then come back to push once more.</Cassandra.description>

  <Phoebe.label>Phoebe Chillax</Phoebe.label>
  <Phoebe.description>Phoebe gives lots of time between disasters to build your colony. But beware - at high difficulties, she'll hit as hard as anyone.</Phoebe.description>

  <Randy.label>Randy Random</Randy.label>
  <Randy.description>Randy doesn't follow rules. He'll generate random events, and he doesn't care if they make a story of triumph or utter hopelessness. It's all drama to him.\n\nWarning: Since Randy is truly random, he will sometimes send extremely difficult or unfair groups of events at you. It makes for high drama - and unavoidable sacrifices.</Randy.description>
